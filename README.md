# Float

Discord bot that does things. Designed for self-hosting.

## Getting started

0. [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) is highly recommended.
1. Download the repository (I recommend [degit](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit).)
2. Run `pnpm build` to compile the source code.
3. Run `pnpm start` to start the bot.

A Docker container will be provided in the future.
